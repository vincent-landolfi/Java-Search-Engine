There is also University of Toronto Libraries which can search for research papers and scholarly journals.

How is our product different compared to UofT Old Exams Repository (OER)?
=========================================================================
1) Compared to the Old Exams Repository (OER), we aim to provide more accurate results in a simpler way. Firstly, the OER search accuracy is subpar often returning an excess of unrelated items. For example, when I searched "cscc01" I receive 278 results with only the first 3 actual CSCC01 exams and the rest are not even CS courses. We aim to provide superior accuracy.

2) The OER only contains exams in pdf format. Our solution will be suitable for uploading .txt, .html, and pdf files. They are not neccesarily past exams, but can contain any related course material such as lecture slide, assignments, code, and many more. An instructor can upload materials such as research papers and articles on our platform if he believes it will assist his students. We are expanding upon what the OER provides, aiming to target a larger customer base. The OER is helpful for people looking for past exams, but we want our solution to assist students beyond that (research paper, lecture slides, code, etc).

3) Since the OER is restricted to users with a valid UTORid, such as UofT students, instructors, UofT staff. We may let users without a UTORid be able to query results and download files. This can be helpful for high school students wanting a head start at UofT.

4) this can be a more elegent way of retrieving course materials. Blackboard can be slow and cumbersome to use. Having to go navigate to each course, course materials, then the possible subfolders can take time. It may be easy to miss any uploaded material. We want our platform to provide an way to "subscribe" to certain course or instructor and have a page showing all materials uploaded. This way it is easy to stay up to date.

5) OER has a rolling set of the previous 3 years. Our product allows students and instructors to upload material, meaning we can potentially have a larger repository.

6) If a professor does not have lecture slides and a student misses a class, another student can upload his notes. Our product can serve as platform for students to share notes.

7) OER Lacks a convenient easy to use advanced search. Our product aims to have an advance search on a single page. 

8) Allow users to favourite/bookmark so they don't have to search same file again


How is our product different compared to University of Toronto Libraries?
=========================================================================
1) The UofT Libraries is useful for searching books, ebooks, articles, journals, library info, and much more. Due to this it has a very large database and queries can return excessive information. This might overwhelm students who have a tight deadline. Due to the nature of our product, determining the relevancy of materials is off-loaded to the students/instructors. They can upload material they found useful which allows us to return the most useful materials.

2) The Libraries, like OER, lack a community and is uploaded material is beyond professor/student control. Our product allows use to build a community through the use of accounts, rating, and uploading.

3) The Libraries has a large catalogue of items. Searching vague terms such as "genetics" can take over 30 seconds to return all items. This means we need to be more specific. Our product is mainly managed by students/professors and will have a more concentrated and smaller catalogue. This will mean potentially quicker query times and more useful results from fewer search terms. The uploaders only upload items they find useful, which is a process of weeding out useless/irrelevant material without relying on an algorithm.





Product better for specific users?
==================================
* Jane, a non-UofT student is currently in high school. She is an eager learner and wants a head start at computer science before her first semester. She cannot use the OER or UofT Libraries since she does not have a UTORid (possibly to restrict access to only paying students and staff), but she use UTSearCh because it is accessible to non-UofT students/professors. 

* Joe is an eager and studious UofT student. He wants to ace his exams, so he decides to do the past 5 years of final exams for his course. Since OER only contains past 3 years of exams (possibly to conserve storage space), Joe can use our product to access older exams if they are uploaded.


* Vince is a nice guy and likes to help those around him. The OER and UofT Libraries does not allow users to upload (possibly to maintain integrity and validity of the catalogue) so Vince uses UTSearCh to upload his notes and past exams.

* Kevin is a professor at UofT, he likes to post research papers and other learning material relevant to his courses so anyone interested can better understand his field. OER and UofT libraries does not allow him to do this, and Blackboard only allows him to post to his specific class (and the post may be unavailable after the course is finished). He uses UTSearCh to upload research papers and material so he can share them to anyone interested.

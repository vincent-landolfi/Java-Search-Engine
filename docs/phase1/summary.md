Objective: Build a search engine for instructors and students at UTSC. This application allows users to create an account, upload files, and query the index in search of files. UTSC community members can also query the index.

Key Users: 

Kevin (Instructor) – A new course instructor at UTSC, who is constantly creating new course-related documents for his students every semester. He also likes to research machine learning in his free time and has published many research papers on it.

Vince (Student) – A 4th year student at UTSC, who has done his fair share of exams throughout his university career. He still hangs on to his exams in case future students want to see them. He constantly goes to each of his courses’ websites to download course-related documents.

Jane (Community Member) – An 11th grade high school student who aspires to attend UTSC for computer science in the next few years. She is very interested in the research that professors at UTSC are doing and is trying to get a head start on her university courses by researching each course as much as possible.

Key Scenarios: 

Kevin just finished completing a very interesting research paper on machine learning. He posts the research paper on his course website, and receives some great feedback from his students, but he is not sure how to share his research with the rest of the UTSC community. Kevin needs a place where he can share his research with the UTSC community.

Students keep asking Vince to borrow his old exams. He has uploaded his exams to google drive, but he constantly has to login and share the files with new students. Vince needs a place where he can post his old exams for other UTSC students to access.

Vince checks each of his courses’ websites every day at noon. On Tuesday, Vince checked the websites for four of his courses, but he forgot to check the CSCC01 website, where the instructor posted an exercise that was due the same night. Vince missed the exercise, and got 0 for not handing it in. Vince needs an easier way to look at course-related documents for his courses.

Jane is excited to go to UTSC in the next couple of years. She is really excited about taking CSCA08, but she doesn’t know what kind of content the course will have. Jane needs somewhere where she can look at course-related documents for CSCA08.

Jane is really interested in the work the professors are doing on machine learning at UTSC. She wants to know about their findings, but when she tries to search for them, she can’t find anything. She needs a way to read research papers about specific topics from UTSC faculty.

Key Principles:

Search Accuracy over Search Efficiency: The design should provide more accurate search results even if it incurs a longer wait time for the user.

Advanced Queries: The design should provide users with the ability to make more precise queries if users know what they are looking for.

Search Availability: The design should provide users with the chance to enter a query at all times, regardless of what page they are on.

No Results Message: The design should provide a clear and concise, “No Results,” message when no results are found, and provide the user with the query they made that produced no results.

Auto-Complete: The design should provide and auto-complete feature to reduce user search times.
